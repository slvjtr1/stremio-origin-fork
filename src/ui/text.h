/* Text: FreeType rasterising, HarfBuzz shaping, FriBidi ordering. A line of text is shaped and
   drawn once into an alpha texture and kept in a cache keyed by its text, size, weight and
   width limit; drawing a cached line is one quad. Inter is the UI face; Arabic script falls
   back to Noto Sans Arabic per run, so mixed lines (an Arabic title with a Latin name) work.
   Anything else (emoji, symbols, CJK, Korean, Hebrew, Thai, Indic...) takes the first system font
   that has it, per cluster (the TV's /usr/share/fonts, macOS's fonts in the preview), mapped on
   first need; emoji are drawn monochrome in the text colour, flags as a country-code tag, and a
   character no font has is dropped (never a box). */

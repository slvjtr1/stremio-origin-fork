/* The background trailer behind the boards, drawn: bgtrailer.c decides when it plays, this plays it through
   the video backend and gives the look its numbers. When it starts, the backdrop pushes in 2.5% and fades off
   the video (1.2 s), which is framed at that same zoom, while the page melts (0.9 s); when it stops, the picture
   fades back over it (0.45 s), the video goes and the picture eases back to its own framing. */

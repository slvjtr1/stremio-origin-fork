/* Titles, descriptions, genres, logos, posters and episode names in the app's language, from TMDB with
   the user's own key (added from the phone: the TV keyboard is no place for 32 characters). Cinemeta is
   English only. One find + one details call per title (+ one per season for a series' page), kept 3 days
   on disk so a title costs nothing the second time. What TMDB has no translation for stays empty: the
   English stays. English UI = no lookups.

   Everything here is for the main thread and never blocks: a lookup that is not known yet is queued for
   the workers and answered by a later frame (draw code reads tmdb_loc() every frame; nothing here does
   disk or network work on the caller's thread). Pointers handed out stay valid until the next frame. */

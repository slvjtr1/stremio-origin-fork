/* Cast receiver: a phone on the same network finds the TV (UDP 8766), pairs once with a 4-digit code shown here,
   then drives it over a WebSocket (TCP 8765): play a stream, pause, resume, seek, stop, remote keys; it is told the
   state about once a second. Platform-neutral: the app gives it hooks and calls cast_tick each
   frame. No threads: two non-blocking sockets polled per frame while idle.
   The messages are JSON objects named by "type": the phone sends hello, then pair (the code) once, and later play,
   pause, resume, seek, stop, key, sub, subdelay, audio, tracks?, settings and account; the TV answers each and sends
   its state (what plays, where, paused or not) about once a second. */
